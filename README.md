## Overview
This project is an AI-powered phone agent that can handle incoming calls, transcribe user speech, generate AI-driven responses, and convert text responses back to speech for real-time communication. It integrates multiple APIs, including **Twilio, Deepgram, Google Gemini, and ElevenLabs**, to create a natural and dynamic conversational experience.

üöÄ **The service is deployed on Render** for seamless cloud-based operation.

üìû **Call this number to use our service:** `‚Ä™+1 575-577-7527‚Ä¨`

## Features
- **Handles Incoming Calls:** Uses **Twilio** to receive phone calls.
- **Speech Transcription:** Utilizes **Deepgram** for accurate and fast voice-to-text conversion.
- **AI-Powered Response Generation:** Employs **Google Gemini** to generate human-like responses.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Uses **ElevenLabs** to generate realistic voice responses.
- **Error Handling & Retries:** Implements robust error handling with request retries.
- **Supports Multiple Conversations:** Allows continuous interactions during a single call.

## How It Works - Step-by-Step
1. **Handling Incoming Calls:** Twilio receives calls and records user speech.
2. **Processing the Recording:** The recording URL is fetched and prepared for processing.
3. **Transcribing Speech to Text:** The recorded speech is transcribed using **Deepgram**.
4. **Generating AI Response:** The transcribed text is passed to **Google Gemini** for response generation.
5. **Converting AI Response to Speech:** **ElevenLabs** generates a realistic speech response.
6. **Playing the Response Back:** The generated speech is played back to the caller using **Twilio**.
7. **Continuing the Conversation:** The user can continue the interaction until they hang up.
